/**
 * [FORK:hook-ext] Fork hook extensions — assembles ForkHooks implementation
 *
 * This module is the single entry point for all fork-specific hook processing.
 * It exports `buildForkHooks` which creates a ForkHooks instance that plugs
 * into settings.ts trigger() via the beforeRunEntry/afterRunEntry callbacks.
 *
 * Architecture:
 * - settings.ts defines the ForkHooks interface (optional callbacks)
 * - This module implements those callbacks using extension modules
 * - The Effect layer in settings.ts calls buildForkHooks() at construction
 *
 * Adding new extensions:
 * 1. Create a new file in this directory (e.g., rate-limiter.ts)
 * 2. Plug into beforeRunEntry or afterRunEntry below
 * 3. Update FORK_POINTS.md with the new bridge point
